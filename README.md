interesting note about HUD: 
> Note that you should use HUDs sparingly as they cause irritation and eye strain in VR. Consider integrating menus into the fabric of the world itself. If you do create a HUD, make sure that the HUD is more in the center of the field of view such that the user does not have to strain their eyes to read it.
